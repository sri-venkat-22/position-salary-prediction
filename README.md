# Position Salary Prediction

A concise project demonstrating **linear regression** vs. **polynomial regression** for predicting salaries based on job position or role.

## Overview
This repository shows how position levels can be used to estimate corresponding salaries. The project uses **simple linear regression** and **polynomial regression** to compare how well each model fits the data.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Reads a dataset and prepares it for modeling.
- **Model Comparison**: Trains both linear and polynomial regression models.
- **Visualization**: Plots the predicted salary curves to illustrate model performance.
- **Ease of Use**: Straightforward code, suitable for beginners to regression concepts.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sri-venkat-22/position-salary-prediction.git
